## Tips & Tricks

### Quick Workflow
1. **Set up a memorable hotkey** - Choose something that feels natural to you

3. **Recent vaults appear first** - Your most-used vaults bubble to the top
4. **Double-click to confirm** - In vault selector, double-click to select and confirm instantly

### Avoiding Conflicts
- **Check existing hotkeys** - Make sure your chosen combination isn't already in use
- **System shortcuts** - Avoid combinations used by your OS (e.g., `Ctrl+Alt+Del` on Windows)
- **Common Obsidian shortcuts** - Don't override frequently used commands

### Multiple Hotkeys
You can set multiple hotkeys for the same command:
1. Click the `+` button again after setting your first hotkey
2. Add an alternative key combination
3. Both hotkeys will work!

## Troubleshooting

### Hotkey Not Working?

1. **Check for conflicts**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Hotkeys
   - Look for a ‚ö†Ô∏è warning icon next to conflicting hotkeys
   - Change one of the conflicting hotkeys

2. **Ensure plugin is enabled**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí Community plugins
   - Make sure Teleporter is toggled ON

3. **File must be open**
   - The hotkey only works when you have a file open in the editor
   - It won't work from the file explorer or graph view

### Resetting Hotkeys

To remove or reset a hotkey:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Hotkeys
2. Search for "Teleport"
3. Click the `x` next to the current hotkey to remove it
4. Add a new hotkey if desired

## Default Workflow Example

Here's a typical workflow with keyboard shortcuts:

1. Edit your file in Obsidian
2. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + M` (your configured hotkey)
3. Press `2` to select your second vault (or use arrows and Enter)
4. Navigate folders with arrow keys or click
5. Press `Enter` to confirm the destination
6. File is moved! üéâ

## Accessibility

The Teleporter plugin is designed with keyboard accessibility in mind:
- **Full keyboard navigation** - Never need to use the mouse
- **Clear visual indicators** - Selected items are highlighted
- **Number shortcuts** - Quick access to first 9 vaults
- **Standard navigation keys** - Arrow keys, Enter, and Escape work as expected
